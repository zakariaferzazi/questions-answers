      "options": ["Isovolumetric contraction", "Ventricular ejection", "Isovolumetric relaxation", "Diastole"],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Ventricular filling occurs during diastole, the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle. During this phase, the ventricles relax, atrioventricular valves (mitral and tricuspid) open, and blood flows from the atria into the ventricles. This phase is critical for cardiac preload, which influences stroke volume via the Frank-Starling mechanism."

      "question": "What is the primary energy system used during a maximal effort lasting 30 seconds?",
      "options": ["Aerobic system", "ATP-PCr system", "Anaerobic glycolysis", "Oxidative phosphorylation"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Anaerobic glycolysis is the primary energy system utilized during maximal efforts lasting approximately 30 seconds. This system rapidly breaks down glucose to produce ATP without oxygen, resulting in lactate accumulation. It bridges the gap between the immediate ATP-PCr system (0-10 seconds) and the aerobic system that dominates in longer activities."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Valsalva maneuver in resistance training refers to holding one's breath while exerting force against resistance. This involves closing the glottis while contracting the abdominal muscles, which increases intra-abdominal pressure and provides core stability. While it can enhance performance during maximal lifts, prolonged breath-holding can cause dangerous spikes in blood pressure."

      "options": ["Blood flow increases equally to all body tissues", "Blood is shunted away from working muscles to vital organs", "Blood flow to the digestive system increases to support energy production", "Blood is redirected to working muscles and away from less essential functions"],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "During high-intensity exercise, blood is redirected to working muscles and away from less essential functions. This process, called exercise-induced hyperemia, involves both central cardiovascular adjustments (increased cardiac output) and local redistribution of blood flow (vasoconstriction in non-essential areas like the digestive system and vasodilation in active muscles)."

      "question": "Which of the following best describes the force-velocity relationship in concentric muscle contractions?",
      "options": ["Force production increases as velocity increases", "Force production decreases as velocity increases", "Force production remains constant regardless of velocity", "Force production is only affected by muscle length, not velocity"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The force-velocity relationship in concentric muscle contractions is characterized by force production decreasing as velocity increases. This inverse relationship exists because fewer cross-bridges can form and generate force when muscle shortening occurs rapidly. Consequently, maximal force production occurs during isometric (zero velocity) or very slow concentric contractions."
