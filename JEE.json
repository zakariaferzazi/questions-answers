Let me recalculate: Term with x³ is C(5,3) × x³ × 2²= 10 × 4 = 40. But we want coefficient of x³, so we need term x³ × 2^(5-3) = x³ × 2² × C(5,3) = x³ × 4 × 10 = 40x³. Actually, using (a+b)ⁿ = Σ C(n,r)aⁿ⁻ʳbʳ, for (x+2)⁵, the x³ term comes from C(5,2)x³2² = 10×4 = 40. Wait, that's still not matching the given answer. Let me be more careful: (x+2)⁵, term with x³ is C(5,3)x³2² = 10×4 = 40x³. So coefficient is 40, but the answer shows 80. Let me recalculate: C(5,3) = 10, and we have x³2² = 4x³, so coefficient is 40.
